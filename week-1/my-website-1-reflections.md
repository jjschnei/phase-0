Create Repo and Clone to Computer. First, log into your GitHub account. Click the + in the upper right corner, then click ‘New Repository’. Create a short memorable name and add a description if you wish.  Choose the options you want for the new repo (e.g. public/private, license, readme, etc.).  Click Create.

Once you’ve created a repo on GitHub, you can “clone” it to your local computer.  Go to the main page of the repo you wish to clone on GitHub.com.  In the right sidebar, click the copy URL for the repo (make sure you select the correct type of URL – if in doubt, use HTTPS).  Open you terminal. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repo (it’s important to get this right).  Use this git command to clone:  git clone [paste copied URL].

Open source means that a project’s code is available to the public.  Furthermore, the public is able to make changes to the code.  This means that open source projects are widely distributed and highly collaborative.  They are often run by not for profit organizations.  The values of open source seem utopian:  Open v. closed, collaborative v. individual, public v. private, collectively v. small groups in control, not profit driven v. profit driven.

Licenses are important. Depending on your goals, you will need to select the right license.  By default the US law makes things private and copyrighted.  If possible, it seems best to use a license that is open source so that others can access and benefit from what you are doing.

This challenge helped solidify a few things.  I now have a more concrete understanding of what open source means.  I also better understand what Sublime is used for.  Before this challenge, I didn’t realize that GitHub could be used to host webpages.

Yes, used google to answer several questions while working on this challenge.  One of the best resources that I found is the GitHub help section:  https://help.github.com/.  There are tons of articles in here to help you through any process on GitHub.
