##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
The tool is very helpful for both html and CSS formatting.  You can inspect and edit the CSS of a page and watch how it changes the website.  This provides instant feedback about how changes in the CSS affect position.
##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Using the DOM, you can open the .css file. You can then edit the CSS in the DOM.  For example, you could change the height or width of an element to resize it.
##What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute:  This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It does not affect the position of any surrounding elements.

Fixed:  This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.  They DO NOT move when the user scrolls.

Static:  Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page.

Relative:  This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This doesn't affect surrounding objects.
##What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Every box has 3 properties to control its appearance:  border, margin and padding.  The is called the CSS Box Model. Every box has a border that separates the edge of the box from another. The margin sits outside of the edge of the border. You can set the margin to create a gap between the bounders of two adjacent boxes.  Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.  It can add the readability of the content.
##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I liked this challenge.  It was a straight-forward way to see how CSS affects positioning.
