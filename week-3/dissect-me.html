    <h3>What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    <p>
      Oh crap, I was trying to add some changes that were suggested by my coworkers
      in Bangladesh, Brazil, and Turkey. But, now I can't find the documents that
      they sent me. They are gone forever!

    <p>
      You should really use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control System</a> for projects like this.
      The most popular exmample of it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>. We use it all the time in software
      development. It's a life saver! You first have to memorize a few odd phrases in
      order to use it in your computer's command line, but once you get the hang of
      it, you'll want to use it everywhere!

      I use it all the time cooking!  I start the recipe on what I call the
      [master branch].
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when I want to experiment with some new flavors, I can make
      additional branches to toy with by pressing [git checkout -b new-branch-name]

    <h3>Why Use GitHub?</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub stores your code “in the cloud”. This makes it easy for distributed teams to work on the same project because they can access it from anywhere over the Internet. This makes GitHub an ideal version control tool for both individuals and distributed teams. In addition to hosted version control and source code management, GitHub also provides social networking functionality. Users have profiles that can show their work and contributions. Projects can be discussed publicly to maximize collaboration.

<!--
##What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
<header>
<main>
<section>
<article>
<footer>
<nav>
<aside>

These continue to come up.  These semantic tags are preferable in HTML5 vs. using div and ID tags.

##How do elements get laid out on a page?

They layout seems to be tied to the tag and CSS associated with various elements.

##What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser displays elements in the order in which they appear in the html doc.

##What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned about snippets. I didn't even know you could use the tab as a shortcut prior to this challange.  I plan to create snippets in the future for both HTML and CSS.  I also think it would be helpful to research shortcuts for both the terminal and sublime.
