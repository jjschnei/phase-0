##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary purpose of my website it or introduce me to potential employers.  The site will feature information about me, my skills, and links to relevant sites (eg my social profiles)


##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience’s interest is to easily evaluate my potential fit at their company.  Both the form (i.e. UX) and content of the site will be important.  Both will need to show that I have proficient technical and interpersonal skills.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action will be to learn who I am from both a technical and personal perspective.  This will include written information, my portfolio, and external links.

UX is important.  It’s a new field and it’s worth is still being debated.  Once you accept that UX is important, the next thing to know is that it’s important to emphasize “user-centered design”.  UX is more important for more complex systems.  At startups, there likely wont be a dedicated UX person. Cultivating a good UX takes time.

User experience design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.  It’s important because how your users / customers feel about your site translates into how they feel about your brand and product.
