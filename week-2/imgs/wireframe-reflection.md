##What is a wireframe?
A very simple and stripped down representation of a website.  It's similar to a building's blue print.  It can be used to plan UX and usablity.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?
There are many benefits, such as:
  1. Testing navigation
  2. Figure out how content best fits on a page
  3. Rapidly refine the user interface
  4. Evaluate the overall usabilit and UX of a site before it's built
  5. Determine front and back end dev requirements

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes, it was very enjoyable. I really like playing with visual elements.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I did a bunch of research and tried a few ideas.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
My main question was "what does great UX looklike?".  I googled 'example of great UX' and created a swipe file of deisgns that I liked.  I went through this to draw inspiration for my own wireframes.
##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed all of it except the having to post to GitHub.
