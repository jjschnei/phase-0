<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was pretty straightforward.  It made it much easier that we had a site to copy instead of creating something from scratch

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Researching HTML5 was easy, however, understanding what everything meant was a challenge.  I am new to HTML4 and HTML5, so reading a comparison between their respective features is difficult to follow

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We did a good job of sticking to the rules.  From what I can tell, we do no formatting in the HTML

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It seems like an easy and straightforward language, which is good. This can also be bad because you are fairly limited in what you can do.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I wrote out my own cheat sheet. The process of writing it and then reviewing it is helping me to memorize the commands
