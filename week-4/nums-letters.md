##What does "puts" do?
Puts stands for 'put string'.  The method returns prints the output to the console and ads a new blank line.

##What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any real, whole number. Said more simply, it's any number without a decimal point. Numbers with decimials are called floats.


##What's the difference between float and integer division?  (Explain it to a non programmer)
Float division is like using a calculator -- it returns remainders.  Integer division does not return remainders.  Instead, it returns the number of times something can be divided without a remainder. For example:  10/3 = 3.


##Hours in Years Ruby Program:
puts 1*365.242*24


##Minutes in a decade Ruby Program:
puts 1*10*365.242*24*60

##Addition, subration, multiplication, and division in Ruby
These all work just like a calculator, except for division. As explained above, there are two types of division:  intger and float divsion.  Float returns the remainder, integer does not.

##What are strings?  Why and when would you use them?
A group of letters in a program. They are mainly used to write words and sentences.  They can be stored as variables.  You can mutiply and add stringss.  Strings would be used in programs to communiate with users.

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
A variable is when you assign a short string (starting with a lowercase letter) to some other object.  You can point your variable to a string or integer or any object.  You can also reasign variables.  You use varaibles so you don't have to keep typing the same thing over and over again.

##How was the challenge
This challenge was pretty easy.  The content was fairly basic and it's review from what we had to learn to appply to DBC.
