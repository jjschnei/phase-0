// Pseudocode
// Write a for statement that iterates through votes
// For each object within votes, iterate through their properties
// Fill votecount with key/values from votes.
// Each object within votecount will need to be updated with the vote tallys
// Iterate through votecount to determine the winners.
// Add the winners to the object officers.

// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// I learned the syntax to do it. I also learned that you have to be very carefull where you define your variables. We ran into a lot of issues with this.

// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// In addition to the for loop from the links, we were onliy able to find the HasOwnProperty() method.

// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// Nothing was completely solidified.  It was a good introduction to iterating over nested objects.  I plan to go back and review this concept to get it solidified.
