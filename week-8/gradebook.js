/*
Gradebook from Names and Scores
I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]
This challenge took me [#] hours.
You will work with the following two variables.  The first, students, holds the names of four students.
The second, scores, holds groups of test scores.  The relative positions of elements within the two
variables match (i.e., 'Joseph' is the first element in students; his scores are the first value in scores.).
Do not alter the students and scores code.

Gradebook from Names and Scores
I worked on this challenge with David Louie
This challenge took me 1.5 hours.

The second, scores, holds groups of test scores.  The relative positions of elements within the two
variables match (i.e., 'Joseph' is the first element in students; his scores are the first value in scores.).
Do not alter the students and scores code.

// pseudocode
/*
create open object gradebook
make each student name in students array a property of gradebook
assign each the value of a new object
give each student property its own test scores
assign respective students their grades from scores array
assign addScore property to gradebook
addscore accepts name and score as arguments and adds scores to student objects
testScore is a property of each student
addscore pushes scores to values of testScore
create getAverage property in gradebook
create average function that accepts an array of integers and returns the average
getAverage accepts a name and returns the student's score using the average function

// __________________________________________
// Reflect

// Getting the syntax right was difficult.   We logically understood what needed to be done, but really struggled getting it right. I need to re-read the article. Itâ€™s important to know when to use dot notation versus brackets.

// In our refactored solution, we used a for loop to iterate through the given variables to add them to the object.

// I learned about reduce.  It sums an array.  This helped us shorten and simplify our average function.
