This is one to one because all states only have on state flower.  Similarly, all state flowers only have one state.

Reflection:
##What is a one-to-one database?
When two things have a single relationship with each other.  For example, states and state capitols.

##When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When two things have a single relationship with each other or when table has so many items that it makes sense to split off the less often used one into another table.

##What is a many-to-many database?
When items in a table each have many relationships and the table they are connected to is also filled with items that have many relationships.

##When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When you have two tables that have a lot of overlaps, it might make sense use a many to many and put a join table between them.

##What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
I find the direction that keys connect confusing.  I can also see how adding several intertwining tables together would get VERY confusing. These basic examples make sense.
